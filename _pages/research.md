<summary>Seats of Loyalty: The Parliamentary Pathway to Democratic Backsliding.</summary>
<p>
Abstract: How does democratic backsliding reshape the ideological landscape of the par- liaments, molding the discourse and distribution of political positions of the elite? Drawing on a unique dataset of speeches from the Turkish Grand National Assem- bly for the entire AKP rule (2002-2023), this study argues that parliaments serve as venues for signaling loyalty to the party in times of backsliding, thereby increasing party cohesion and facilitating democratic backsliding. It reveals that democratic backsliding correlates with a progressively narrowed ideological space, deepening ideological divides between parties, and increasing party loyalty among the MPs on dimensions critical to the regime’s stability. These changes are driven by the strate- gic disciplining of MPs’ ideology by aspiring autocrats, who intensify the use of ideological conformity as a criterion for candidate selection, thereby cementing their control over political discourse. By revealing the adaptive strategies of political elites and parties under autocratic pressures, this research contributes to our broader understanding of the resilience of democratic systems and the conditions under which they are undermined.

Abstract: Candidate selection practices based on traditional and social ties, such as kinship, challenge the very essence of democratic governance and can lead to elite capture. Employing a regression discontinuity design, we scrutinize the role of incumbency in bolstering kinship networks in municipal councils, utilizing a comprehensive dataset from local council elections in Turkey. Our analysis reveals a pronounced effect of incumbency in increasing the importance of family networks within representative institutions. Significantly, we reveal that educational attainment serves as a crucial moderating factor in this relationship, with the impact of incumbency on kinship politics notably weakening in regions with higher levels of educational attainment. Drawing on data from an expansive survey of candidates and households,we delve into the mechanisms through which kinship-based candidacies entrench themselves within the fabric of local political governance. We further illustrate that education imparts distinct influences on political self-efficacy and aspirations between individuals embedded in kinship networks and those outside such networks. This divergence impacts the competitive landscape for elected positions, as localities with low educational attainment tend to have a lower supply of candidates outside of kinship networks. These findings emphasize the pivotal role of education in potentially eradicating kinship politics, thereby enriching the ongoing discourse on political dynasties and modernization theory.

<summary>The Gender Effect in Intra-Party Meritocracy. With <a href="https://www.tugbabozcaga.com">Tugba Bozcaga (King's College)</a></summary>
<p>
Abstract: This study explores the impact of gender on intra-party meritocracy within closed-list proportional representation systems, focusing on the Turkish political context. While previous research highlights gender disparities in political representation and candidate selection, this paper specifically examines how legislative effort influences the placement of candidates on electoral lists. Using comprehensive data from the Turkish Parliament and national elections between 2002 and 2018, we find that while parliamentary effort does not significantly affect list placement overall, there is a marked gender discrepancy. Female MPs face higher benchmarks for legislative effort to secure favorable list positions compared to their male counterparts. This disparity is particularly pronounced in electorally competitive districts, where the stakes are higher, exacerbating the challenges for female candidates. The findings suggest that gender biases continue to influence political candidacy assignments through gender-based implementation of meritocratic criteria, thereby limiting women's representation in competitive political environments.

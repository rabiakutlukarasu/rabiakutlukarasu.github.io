<summary>Seats of Loyalty: The Parliamentary Pathway to Democratic Backsliding.</summary>
<p>
Abstract: How does democratic backsliding reshape the ideological landscape of the parliaments, molding the discourse and distribution of political positions of the elite? Drawing on a unique dataset of speeches from the Turkish Grand National Assembly for the entire AKP rule (2002-2023), this study argues that parliaments serve as venues for signaling loyalty to the party in times of backsliding, thereby increasing party cohesion and facilitating democratic backsliding. It reveals that democratic backsliding correlates with a progressively narrowed ideological space within the parliament, deepening ideological divides between parties, and increasing party loyalty among the MPs on dimensions critical to the regime’s stability. These changes are driven by the strategic disciplining of MPs’ ideology by aspiring autocrats, who intensify the use of ideological conformity as a criterion for candidate selection, thereby cementing their control over political discourse. By revealing the adaptive strategies of political elites and parties under autocratic pressures, this research contributes to our broader understanding of the resilience of democratic systems and the conditions under which they are undermined.

<summary>The Effect of Incumbency on Local Political Dynasties and Elite Capture. With <a href="https://www.tugbabozcaga.com">Tugba Bozcaga (King's College)</a>, <a href="https://aytugsasmaz.com">Aytug Sasmaz (Bryn Mawr College)</a></summary>

Abstract: Candidate selection practices rooted in kinship and traditional social ties can lead to elite capture, undermining democratic governance. This study examines how incumbency strengthens kinship networks within local political institutions, with a focus on the role of education, using data from municipal council elections in Turkey. Our regression discontinuity design reveals that incumbency significantly enhances the role of family networks, particularly in regions with lower educational attainment. To explore the mechanisms, we draw on data from an expansive survey of candidates and households and find that education plays a key role in weakening the grip of kinship politics, as it shapes political self-efficacy and aspirations differently for those within and outside kinship networks. This divergence limits the pool of non-kinship candidates in less educated areas, perpetuating a cycle of poor governance. Our study highlights the critical role of education in disrupting this cycle, contributing to discussions on political dynasties and modernization.

<summary>The Gender Effect in Intra-Party Meritocracy. With <a href="https://www.tugbabozcaga.com">Tugba Bozcaga (King's College)</a></summary>
<p>
Abstract: This study explores the impact of gender on intra-party meritocracy within closed-list proportional representation systems, focusing on the Turkish political context. While previous research highlights gender disparities in political representation and candidate selection, this paper specifically examines how legislative effort influences the placement of candidates on electoral lists. Using comprehensive data from the Turkish Parliament and national elections between 2002 and 2018, we find that while parliamentary effort does not significantly affect list placement overall, there is a marked gender discrepancy. Female MPs face higher benchmarks for legislative effort to secure favorable list positions compared to their male counterparts. This disparity is particularly pronounced in electorally competitive districts, where the stakes are higher, exacerbating the challenges for female candidates. The findings suggest that gender biases continue to influence political candidacy assignments through gender-based implementation of meritocratic criteria, thereby limiting women's representation in competitive political environments.

<summary>Quality in Service Provision, Citizen Complaints, and Local Accountability: Evidence from Turkey With <a href="https://www.tugbabozcaga.com">Tugba Bozcaga (King's College)</a>, <a href="https://www.ashrakatelshehawy.com">Ashrakat Elshehawy (Stanford University)</a></summary>

Abstract: How do biases stemming from the quality of private services and partisanship affect the extent to which people hold their local governments accountable? Utilizing a unique panel dataset on complaints made to the Istanbul Municipality from 2013 to 2023, this study examines whether low-quality private services, such as electricity outages, increase official complaints made to municipal authorities, despite their limited and regulatory role in these services. Additionally, the study explores the extent to which co-partisanship —the degree of support the incumbent mayor receives from the constituency— influences the number of complaints. To address concerns of reverse causality, this study employs a natural experiment based on the timing of unplanned electricity outages. The findings contribute to the literature on accountability by highlighting a critical factor that can limit the effectiveness of vertical accountability mechanisms.

Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Stanford University, where my research explores the intersection of authoritarianism, elite behavior, and political institutions, with a regional focus on the Middle East. My work primarily focuses on the dynamics of hegemonic party formation and the strategies ruling parties use to shape elite behavior, consolidate power, and control political discourse. I specialize in understanding how democratic institutions, such as parliaments, are co-opted during periods of democratic backsliding to serve authoritarian purposes. By examining the mechanisms of representation and accountability in these contexts, I aim to uncover the processes that facilitate democratic erosion and the challenges involved in countering it. In addition to my work on party politics and elite behavior, I am developing a second stream of research focused on top-down secularization processes and their enduring effects on political identities and ideologies. My research employs quasi-experimental statistical designs and computational text analysis, informed by fieldwork and novel data sources.

At Stanford, I co-organize Comparative Politics Graduate Students Workshop in Political Science Department, and serve as a Graduate Student Network Coordinator at Abbasi Program.

Before beginning my graduate studies at Stanford, I earned my B.A. and M.A. in Political Science from Bogazici University in Istanbul.

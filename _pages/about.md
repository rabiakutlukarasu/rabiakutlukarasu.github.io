Welcome! I'm Rabia Kutlu Karasu, a PhD Candidate in Political Science at Stanford University. My research is situated at the crossroads of comparative politics, political economy, and political behavior, with a regional focus on the Middle East. I explore how democratic institutions are systematically undermined, leading to the consolidation of power by hegemonic parties and the entrenchment of political elites. By examining the mechanisms of representation and accountability in these contexts, I aim to uncover the processes that facilitate democratic erosion and the challenges involved in countering it. My research employs quasi-experimental statistical designs and text analysis, informed by fieldwork and novel data sources.

At Stanford, I co-organize Comparative Politics Graduate Students Workshop in Political Science Department, and Graduate Student Network Coordinator at Abbasi Program.

Before beginning my graduate studies at Stanford, I earned my B.A. and M.A. in Political Science from Boğaziçi University in Istanbul.

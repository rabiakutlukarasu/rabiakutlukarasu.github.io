Hello! I am a 3rd-year PhD Candidate in Political Science at Stanford University. My research lies at the intersection of comparative politics, political economy, and political behavior, with a substantive focus on legislative politics, distributive politics, and public opinion in authoritarian countries. The regional focus of my studies is in the Middle East. In my research I use quasi-experimental statistical designs, text analysis, and novel data sources informed by fieldwork and archival research.Â
